# Fake Store Shopping Cart

## What is this?

This is a front-end application where users can browser a list of fake items and add them to a shopping cart. This is mainly a practice app for me to get experience using TypeScript with React.  Item data comes from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
